# SE_PROJECT_REACT

This app recomcends clothing suitable to varying weather conditions.

Vite and React were used to bundle and optomize the code.
The HTML markup was destructured into components with jsx and JavaScript and styled with CSS.
Components' state was managed with hooks, such as 'useState' and 'useEffect'.
In JS, I implemented: arrow functions, destructuring, array methods(like map() and filter()),

Currently, two official plugins are available:

    - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
    - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
